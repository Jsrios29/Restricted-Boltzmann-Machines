# Restricted-Boltzmann-Machines
This repository contains files for a project where a Restricted Boltzmann Machine is trained and used to make predictions on an existing data set.
This README gives a description of the files in this project.

1. Main File(s) <br />
  RestrictedBoltzmannMachine.pdf - This PDF describes the entire project: From the mathematical background, the training, and the application of the RBM to the data.<br />
2. Source File(s) <br />
  dataFormat.py - this file loads the raw data from Data.csv, and outputs the training data as "trainData.txt", and "trainMap.txt". Additionally, the validation       data is outputted as "valData.txt" <br />

4. Data Files(s)
5. References<br />
  NeurIPS 2020 Challenge.pdf - this PDF contains the origin of the data set and details the challenged that was posed by NeurIPS in 2020.<br />
  Intro_to_RBM_Fischer_Ingel - this PDF contains a nice intro to RBMs<br />
